# ANOMALY-DETECTION-IN-TIME-SERIES-DATA

This project's goal is to find irregularities in a time-series dataset. Anomalies in the
dataset, which was gathered from a city infrastructure system, correspond to
cyberattacks. We need to create an algorithm that can learn some nominal patterns
and identify deviations from the nominal patterns (i.e., anomalous instances) in the
testing dataset.
The training dataset only contains nominal instances; thus, your training dataset is
entirely made up of nominal examples. Both nominal and abnormal cases are
present in the testing dataset. The test labels with a value of 0 or 1 denote nominal
or anomalous data instances, respectively. You do not require a training labels
document because the entire training dataset is nominal (i.e., all training labels are
zero).
