# ANOMALY-DETECTION-IN-TIME-SERIES-DATA

Developed an algorithm to detect anomalies in a time-series dataset sourced from a city infrastructure system, where anomalies indicated cyberattacks.
Utilized a training dataset containing only nominal instances and analyzed a testing dataset with both nominal and anomalous cases.
Identified deviations from learned nominal patterns to detect anomalies, using test labels to indicate nominal (0) or anomalous (1) instances.
Employed advanced Machine Learning models and techniques such as KNN Imputer, DecisionTreeClassifier, OneClassSVM, and Isolation Forest to ensure precision and accuracy in anomaly detection.
Applied dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and FastICA to enhance model performance.
